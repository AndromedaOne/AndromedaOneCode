*** for our code to figure out what robot it's running on there needs to be a;
name.conf
file in the home lvuser home directory on the roborio
the file needs to look like this:


robot {
        name=<robot name, for example SwerveBot>
}


NOTE: the name must exactly match the name used in Config4905 construtor to
figure out which robot we're on.
